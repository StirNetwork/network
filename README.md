# Sunrise Networks

This repository contains the configuration files for Sunrise networks.

Please refer to the [Sunrise Docs](https://docs.sunriselayer.io/) for guides on running your own node. The configuration files `genesis.json` and `addrbook.json` are intended for use by Consensus nodes and should be placed in the node's home directory (by default `$HOME/.sunrise/config`).

|---------|--------------|----------------------------|
| Testnet | `sunrise-test`    |       |
| Mainnet | `sunrise-1`   |    |

## Software versions
